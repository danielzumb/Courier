When using a GMAIL account, you must ensure that the setting "Less secure app access" is turned ON. To do this, please visit https://myaccount.google.com/security and modify this setting to be ON.

Failure to do so will return an Error: Invalid credentials (Failure) message due to Google blocking the authentication.
